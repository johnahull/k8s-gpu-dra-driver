# Installation & Developer Guide

This document collects the common build, package, and demo commands used for
working with the k8s-gpu-dra-driver repository. It pulls together the Makefile
and demo script workflows so you can reproduce builds and demos locally.

## Prerequisites

- GNU Make 3.81+
- Docker with BuildKit support and image build/push capabilities
- helm v3.7.0+
- kubectl

A build container has been provided with Makefile targets to invoke builds inside
the container (e.g., `make docker-build`). If you plan to build locally, you need
a Go toolchain and C compiler (`build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu).

## Environment

The repository exposes defaults in `env.sh`. You can override any of these on
the command line or in your shell. Common variables:

- `DRIVER_IMAGE_REGISTRY` — container registry to push images to (default `docker.io/rocm`)
- `DRIVER_IMAGE_NAME` — image name (default project driver name)
- `DRIVER_IMAGE_TAG` — image tag (default derived from chart appVersion or `dev`)
- `KIND_CLUSTER_NAME` — kind cluster name used by demo scripts

Example to override registry and tag for a one-off build:

```bash
DRIVER_IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io/rocm DRIVER_IMAGE_TAG=dev make build
```
Note: `env.mk` is a generated Makefile fragment produced from `env.sh` by the Makefile. Do not edit `env.mk` directly — edit `env.sh` and run any Makefile target (e.g., `make build`) to regenerate it.

## Build the driver image

Use the Makefile's `build` target which wraps the repository build script and
containerized build rules. This ensures consistent images and stamping.

```bash
# Build (containerized build or local, as configured in Makefile)
make build

# Build locally without container wrapper (if desired)
make docker-cmds
```

The `build` target depends on `env.mk` (generated from `env.sh`) so ensure any
overrides are passed to `make` or exported in your shell.

## Pushing images and charts to registries

Image pushing is performed by the `Makefile` target `push` (invokes script
`scripts/push-driver-image.sh`). Run `make push` to push images to your driver
registry. Helm charts are available in rocm to install without local builds.

## Package the Helm chart

The repo provides a `helm` Make target that packages the chart under
`helm-charts-k8s/`.

```bash
# Create the packaged chart (tarball in helm-charts-k8s/)
make helm
```

The packaging uses the chart under `helm-chart-k8s/` as the source directory.
The packaging uses the chart under `helm-chart-k8s/` as the source directory.

## Install the driver via Helm

Install the driver using a packaged chart or directly from the chart directory:

```bash
# Install from packaged chart (package created by `make helm`)
helm install --create-namespace --namespace k8s-gpu-dra-driver k8s-gpu-dra-driver \
  helm-charts-k8s/k8s-gpu-dra-driver-helm-k8s-<version>.tgz

# Or install directly from the chart directory during development
helm install --create-namespace --namespace k8s-gpu-dra-driver \
  k8s-gpu-dra-driver helm-chart-k8s/ \
  --set image.repository=${DRIVER_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/${DRIVER_IMAGE_NAME} \
  --set image.tag=${DRIVER_IMAGE_TAG}
```

Adjust values via `--set` or by editing `helm-chart-k8s/values.yaml`.

## Demos and examples

For an end-to-end walkthrough of creating a kind cluster, loading the driver image, installing the chart, and running example workloads with verification steps, see:

## Helm Configuration Reference

### Driver prerequisite

The DRA driver relies on the `amdgpu` kernel driver to enumerate GPU devices.
The Helm chart enforces this by running a `driver-init` init container in the
kubelet plugin DaemonSet pod. This container polls `/sys/class/kfd` and
`/sys/module/amdgpu/drivers/` and blocks the plugin from starting until the
kernel driver is loaded.

### Key values

| Value | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `image.repository` | `docker.io/rocm/k8s-gpu-dra-driver` | Driver container image repository |
| `image.tag` | Chart `appVersion` | Driver container image tag |
| `image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.init.image` | `busybox:1.36` | Init container image used for the driver readiness check |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.init.securityContext` | `{privileged: true}` | Security context for the init container |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.init.resources` | `{}` | Resource requests/limits for the init container |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.plugin.securityContext` | `{privileged: true}` | Security context for the plugin container |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.plugin.resources` | `{}` | Resource requests/limits for the plugin container |
| `kubeletPlugin.containers.plugin.healthcheckPort` | `51515` | gRPC health check port; set negative to disable |
| `kubeletPlugin.nodeSelector` | `{}` | Node selector for the kubelet plugin DaemonSet |
| `kubeletPlugin.tolerations` | `[]` | Tolerations for the kubelet plugin DaemonSet |
| `kubeletPlugin.priorityClassName` | `system-node-critical` | Priority class for the kubelet plugin pods |
| `cdi.dynamicPath` | `/var/run/cdi` | Host path for CDI spec files |
